This is a short documentation on how to use this application:

1. Show all the Monitoring todos (completed and not completed):
- Use the command `python monitor.py show` to see all monitor todos

2. Adding a new Monitoring todo to the list:
- Simply use the command `python monitor.py add "Description" "Category" "monitors" "Server path" seconds
- Categories are either "test" for testing or "train" for gathering training data
- Seconds have to be > 0
- Monitors are the monitors you wish to start m1,m2 = monitor for ressources and HPC m3 = syscalls
- Server path is the rsync path to where you would like to save the data i.e "root@194.233.160.46:/root/data"
- Examples: 
        * `python monitor.py add "Testing the normal behavior for 10 minutes" "test" "m1,m2" "root@194.233.160.46:/root/data" 600
        -> Executes monitor 1 and 2 for 10 min each and sends the data to root@194.233.160.46:/root/data

3. Deleting a todo Monitor Service:
- Simply indicate the index in the `python monitor.py show` task you want to delete
- Example: `python monitor.py delete 1` This will delete the first enty in the table

4. See all systemd services (status of these services):
_ Simple run `python monitor.py services`
